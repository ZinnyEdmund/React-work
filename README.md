# Role-Based Dashboard React TypeScript App

### Overview

This project is a multi-page React application built with TypeScript. It dynamically renders a dashboard based on user roles, using React hooks, routing, and conditional rendering.

### Features

* **Role-Based Access**: Different users (e.g, Admin, Editor, Viewer) see different dashboard content.
* **Routing**: Uses react-router-dom for navigation between pages.
* **State Management**: Utilizes React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing authentication and role-based access.
* **Conditional Rendering**: Components and UI elements are displayed based on user roles.

### Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Context API for state management
- CSS for styling

### Usage

* **Login as Different Users**: Simulate different roles.
* **Dynamic Dashboard**: The displayed content changes based on the logged-in user's role.
